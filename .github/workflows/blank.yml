# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "BTC-SLOAN-@-2023" branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
